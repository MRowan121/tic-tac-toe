# tic-tac-toe

### `Abstract:`
For this project, I built a tic-tac-toe application from scratch. I have been learning the main foundations of building a front-end application over the last five weeks and this project allowed me to put that knowledge to the test.

### `Installation Instructions:`
1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/MRowan121/tic-tac-toe)
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
10. Open the local repository by typing:
    * Atom - atom .
    * VS Code - code .

### `Context:`
It took me a roughly 2 days to write the inital JavaScript, 2 days to build out HTML & CSS, and 2 days to refactor as needed for this project. I just completed my fifth week of Mod 1 at Turing School.

### `Learning Goals:`
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    * DRY JavaScript
    * event delegation to handle similar event listeners
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
4. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### `Technology Used:`
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 

### `Personal Wins`
1. I was able to successfully add the functionality for a user to select which "token" they would like to use. Being that I'm a Jaguars fan, I made this application AFC South related so the options would be Colts, Jaguars, Texans, or Titans. 
2. Once player one has selected their token/logo, that token is removed from the available options for player two which ensures that both players could not use the same token.
3. I was able to add a transition effect to the available team logos. On hover, the logo will grow in size so that the user knows exactly which logo they are about to potentially select. This was the first time I have incorporated the transition property within any of my CSS. 

### `Future Additions`
1. Local Storage so that the user can refresh the page but maintain their game data.
2. Expand on the available teams and add in the remaining NFL logos.
